# Hello, I'm Justin
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/justin-deisler"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for AI-powered applications, web and mobile development, with particular expertise in healthcare technology solutions, high-performance web applications, and intelligent agent systems. I am eager to apply my skills in building scalable, user-centric applications that leverage cutting-edge AI technologies.

## AI-Assisted Development Approach

I leverage modern AI-powered development workflows to accelerate delivery while maintaining high code quality standards and architectural integrity. My approach combines:
**Spec-Driven Development:** Creating comprehensive technical specifications before implementation, enabling AI assistants to generate production-ready code that aligns with architectural vision and project requirements.
**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration:** Connecting Claude with extended context through MCP servers, providing deep codebase understanding, real-time documentation access, and project-specific knowledge that enhances AI assistance accuracy and relevance.
**AI Agent Workflows:** Utilizing autonomous AI agents for complex tasks including architecture design, code generation, debugging, optimization, and documentation, while maintaining human oversight and decision-making authority for all architectural choices.
This methodology has proven instrumental across all three portfolio projects, enabling rapid development cycles, comprehensive code reviews, and sophisticated problem-solving while preserving full technical ownership and ensuring production-grade quality.
